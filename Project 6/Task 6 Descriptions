Problem
Cross-Validation Grid Search with Random Forest
 In this Project, you will conduct a grid search over the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) and the maximum depth of a tree (max_depth) for a random forest model on the case study data. You will then create a visualization showing the average testing score for the grid of hyperparameters that you searched over.
Train a decision tree model in scikit-learn
Use Graphviz to visualize a trained decision tree model
Formulate the cost functions used to split nodes in a decision tree
Perform a hyperparameter grid search using cross-validation with scikit-learn functions
Train a random forest model in scikit-learn
Evaluate the most important features in a random forest model
This lesson introduces decision trees and random forests in scikit-learn in addition to describing the method to perform hyperparameter grid search.
